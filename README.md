Facial Recognition with LFW Dataset

60/20/20 Split, Two Models (Logistic Regression & Decision Tree), Full Metrics

This project demonstrates facial recognition classification using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. Two machine learning models‚ÄîLogistic Regression (OvR) and a Decision Tree‚Äîare trained and evaluated using a stratified 60/20/20 split (train/validation/test).

We evaluate the models using classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves, with proper preprocessing and scaling to ensure fair comparison.

üìÇ Dataset

Source: fetch_lfw_people
 (built into scikit-learn)

Filtering: Only people with ‚â•70 images are included to avoid extremely small classes.

Shape:

Samples: n_samples

Features: flattened grayscale images (n_features)

Classes: multiple public figures (n_classes)

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

Data Preparation

Load LFW dataset

Apply stratified split:

60% training

20% validation

20% test

Preprocessing

Features scaled with StandardScaler (important for linear models).

Scaling fitted only on training set to avoid data leakage.

Models

Logistic Regression (One-vs-Rest)

Solver: liblinear

Max iterations: 2000

Decision Tree

Depth: max 25

Min samples split: 4

Evaluation

Final models trained on train + validation (common practice after fixing hyperparameters).

Metrics:

Classification report (precision, recall, F1)

Confusion matrix visualization

ROC curve (OvR, per-class AUC)

üìä Results Summary
Model	Accuracy	Macro F1	Weighted F1	Notes
Logistic Regression OvR	~85%	~0.82	~0.84	Performs better on high-dimensional data
Decision Tree	~70%	~0.67	~0.69	More interpretable, but prone to overfitting

Values are approximate and may vary slightly per run due to random splits.

Models are not tuned; hyperparameters are fixed for simplicity.

Validation set included to reflect realistic ML workflow.

Scaling only applied to models requiring it.
